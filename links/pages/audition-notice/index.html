            <h3>Character Breakdowns</h3>
            <h4>Nora</h4>
            <p>
                Female 25-35  ALTO (F3-E5)
                Bland, mild-mannered, and dull. Has very few ambitions in life, very few hobbies, and very limited interests, and is content with this. During act two, she finds her spark, and is strong, determined, and focused. 
            </p>

            <h4>Iris</h4>
            <p>
                Female 25-35 SOPRANO (C4-B5)
                Nora’s wife returned from the dead as a ghost. She is sweet, but can be manipulative, and will do anything to achieve her goals. Is slow to anger, but when she is wronged, stay out of her way. 
            </p>

            <h4>Melanie</h4>
            <p>
                Female, 18-30 SOPRANO BELTER (Ab3 -D#5)
                Nora’s coworker, bright and upbeat. She goes through life with a positive attitude, but is quickly overwhelmed when placed in Nora’s position, showing a bit of a manic side. 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Adrian, Taylor, & Sam</h4>
            <p>
                A trio of gossip-obsessed coworkers of Melanie and Nora. They are scheming, nosy, and over-the-top. These three can be played by actors of any gender - we’re looking to cast a group that covers a variety of voice types.
            </p>

            <h4>Ensemble</h4>
            <p>
                Strong singers, actors, and dancers. Play a variety of roles throughout the show, including office workers, townspeople, and eldritch horrors. 
            </p>

            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>
                Nora lives an incredibly mundane life, until a mysterious stranger leaves a diary at her door. With it comes Iris, the spirit of Nora's deceased wife, who gives her a terrible bargain: kill someone else to bring her back. When Nora shuts down and refuses to engage with the plot, eldritch forces rewrite the story from within, recasting Melanie in Nora's role. Newly invigorated and having seen the seams of the universe, Nora sets out to save Melanie from her fate.
