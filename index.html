                    Hello! Welcome to <i>Nowhere Near You!</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Nowhere Near You is a fansite dedicated to the musical Blood Runs Cold. Blood Runs Cold is a Horror Comedy Musical that was performed at Fourth Wall Theater in the summer of 2022.<br>
                    <br>
                    
                    I saw Blood Runs Cold back in July of 2022, and it immediately became one of my favorite musicals. But after seeing it, I realized just how little information there is online about this show, it's like it doesn't exist at all.<br>
                    <br>

                    I decided to make this website as a way to collect and archive everything I can find about Blood Runs Cold. I did a lot of digging through things designer portfolios, Fourth Wall Theater's Archive, and social media in order to find everything you see here. The Media page has all of the images that I was able to find, and the Links page has links to other websites that mention Blood Runs Cold. If you found something I missed, feel free to send it to me. And if anyone happens to have a recording of the show, please please please send it to me, I would love to watch it again. <br>
                    <br>
                    I hope you enjoy!   <br>
                    <br>
